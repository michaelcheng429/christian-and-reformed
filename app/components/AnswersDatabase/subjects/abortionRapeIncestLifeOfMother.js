            <h3>Quick answer</h3>
            <p>Since life begins at conception, and since every human is made in the image of God, we do not have the right to end the life of any human without biblical cause or to decide that one life is more valuable than another.</p>

            <h3>Detailed answer</h3>

            <h4>Life begins at conception</h4>
            <p>The Bible teaches that life begins at conception:</p>

            <blockquote>For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother's womb. I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are your works; my soul knows it very well. My frame was not hidden from you, when I was being made in secret, intricately woven in the depths of the earth. Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in your book were written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there was none of them. (Psalm 139:13-16)</blockquote>

            <p>Babies are known by God "in [their] mother's womb," and even before they were conceived&mdash;when they are still "unformed" and have not even started living "the days that were formed for [them]."</p>

            <h4>Abortion of any kind is murder</h4>
            <p>The intentional and active ending of any human life without biblical cause is murder, and God prohibits murder:</p>

            <blockquote>You shall not murder. (Exodus 20:13)</blockquote>

            <p>Ending the life of a baby, even if this baby was conceived as a result of sin (as in rape or incest), or choosing to save the mother by aborting the baby, is always murder and therefore prohibited by God.</p>

            <h4>Not emotionally easy, but the Bible is clear</h4>

            <p>This truth can certainly be very emotionally difficult, especially in the case of the mother's life being at risk. In circumstances such as these, we must depend upon the sovereignty, wisdom, and goodness of God, understand that God has the power and authority to both give and take away life, and recognize that doctors' judgments may be wrong. We must always seek to save life rather than choose to end life.</p>
