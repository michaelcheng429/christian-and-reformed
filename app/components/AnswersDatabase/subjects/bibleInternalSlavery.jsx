            <h3>Quick answer</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>"Slave" in the Bible can also be translated "servant" or "bondservant." Slavery in the Bible is completely different from the kind of slavery referred to in this argument. Slavery in the Bible was more like lifetime employment (which certainly had its own problems, but had a genuine purpose) as opposed to the kidnapping and harsh, forced labor referred to in this argument. Many people in the Bible would voluntarily sell themselves into "slavery" to have their debts be covered and would be set free in six years.</li>
                <li>God gave regulations for "slavery," or "bondservanthood," in the Bible to protect the rights and dignity of slaves/bondservants.</li>
                <li>Christians (for example, William Wilberforce) led the fight to abolish slavery. Professing "Christians" who used the Bible to support slavery and dehumanize and mistreat slaves were not genuine Christians, but rather non-Christians who misused the Bible to justify and support their sin.</li>
            </ol>
