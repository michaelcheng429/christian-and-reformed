            <h3>Quick answer</h3>
            <p>An extremely strong case can be made for Jesus' existence from examining history itself. However, because there are limits to what we can prove with absolute certainty by merely examining history, the greatest evidence for Jesus' existence is the necessity of the Christian worldview for life and knowledge itself, which results in no other option than to trust the reliability of the Bible's teachings concerning Jesus.</p>

            <h3>Detailed answer</h3>
            <h4>Limits to merely examining history</h4>

            <p>The problem with trying to prove history by examining history is that history is not re-creatable. The best we can do is demonstrate that something in history <strong>most likely</strong> happened based upon the evidence we do have. However, one can always ask the question, "But what if...," with at least some degree of legitimacy. The question may be extremely unlikely, even to the point of absurdity (which is usually the case for arguments against Jesus' very existence), but one cannot really prove with absolute certainty, when merely examining history empirically, that something extremely unlikely did <strong>not</strong> happen.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, even if we could demonstrate with certainty that Jesus existed by empirical methods, that does not also prove that Jesus performed miracles or that he is God. Again, there are severe limitations to trying to prove the Bible solely by empirical methods.</p>

            <p>Here, we will both examine the empirical evidence for Jesus' existence, as well as the presuppositional argument, which is more powerful.</p>

                    <strong>The gospel accounts</strong> &ndash; The gospel accounts contain firsthand eyewitness accounts of Jesus' life. People who doubt these accounts must answer these questions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>What reason do you have to doubt these accounts?</li>
                        <li>Were the writers deceived? If so, how could they have been deceived about the very existence of a man they wrote about?</li>
                        <li>Were the writers lying? If so, why would they be willing to die for a fictional person they created?</li>
                        <li>How could there have been multiple accounts about a fictional man? Did these authors conspire together to create Jesus? If so, for what reason?</li>

                    <strong>Tacitus (55/56&ndash;118 A.D.)</strong> &ndash; Tacitus was a Roman senator, orator, ethnographer, and esteemed historian. He was hostile to Christianity, so in the passage below, Tacitus is either telling the truth about history, or he was deceived, which is extremely unlikely, since Jesus' death would have been within one generation of Tacitus' writing. It is extremely improbable that Jesus would have become a legend in this short amount of time.
                    <blockquote>[N]either human effort nor the emperor’s generosity nor the placating of the gods ended the scandalous belief that the fire had been ordered [by Nero]. Therefore, to put down the rumor, Nero substituted as culprits and punished in the most unusual ways those hated for their shameful acts … whom the crowd called “Chrestians.” <strong>The founder of this name, Christ [Christus in Latin], had been executed in the reign of Tiberius by the procurator Pontius Pilate</strong> … Suppressed for a time, the deadly superstition erupted again not only in Judea, the origin of this evil, but also in the city [Rome], where all things horrible and shameful from everywhere come together and become popular. (<em>Annals</em>, (c. 116&ndash;117 A.D.))</blockquote>
                    One who believes Tacitus was deceived in thinking that Jesus existed must answer the question, "What good reason do you have for thinking Tacitus was deceived about Jesus' very existence? How did Jesus become some kind of non-existent legend described in such historical terms by such an esteemed historian in this amount of time?"

                    <strong>Josephus (37&ndash;100 A.D.)</strong> &ndash; Josephus was a Jewish historian who was eventually employed by the Romans. His writings contain two passages that reference Jesus, one of which is essentially unanimously accepted as genuine, and the other of which is more disputed. Here is the first passage:
                    <blockquote>Being therefore this kind of person [i.e., a heartless Sadducee], Ananus, thinking that he had a favorable opportunity because Festus had died and Albinus was still on his way, called a meeting [literally, “sanhedrin”] of judges and brought into it <strong>the brother of Jesus-who-is-called-Messiah</strong> ... James by name, and some others. He made the accusation that they had transgressed the law, and he handed them over to be stoned. (<em>Jewish Antiquities</em>, 93/94 A.D.)</blockquote>
                    There is really no reason to doubt this minor reference to Jesus at all. Josephus even qualifies Jesus with the phrase, "who-is-called-messiah," which also makes sense because Josephus would not have viewed Jesus as the actual messiah. Like with Tacitus, one who doubts this passage as being strong evidence for Jesus' existence must answer several questions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>What good reason do you have for believing this passage is not genuine?</li>
                        <li>Was Josephus deceived about Jesus' existence? If so, what good reason do you have for believing this? How did Jesus become some kind of non-existent legend described in such historical terms in an even shorter time than Tacitus's writing?</li>
                    </ul>
                    Here is the second passage about Jesus in Josephus's writings, the one that is more disputed:
                    <blockquote>Around this time there lived Jesus, a wise man, <em>if indeed one ought to call him a man</em>. For he was one who did surprising deeds, and a teacher of such people as accept the truth gladly. He won over many Jews and many of the Greeks. <em>He was the Messiah</em>. When Pilate, upon hearing him accused by men of the highest standing among us, had condemned him to be crucified, those who in the first place came to love him did not give up their affection for him, <em>for on the third day, he appeared to them restored to life. The prophets of God had prophesied this and countless other marvelous things about him</em>. And the tribe of Christians, so called after him, have still to this day not died out. (<em>Testimonium Flavianum</em>)</blockquote>
                    The difficulty with this passage is the italicized portions, since Josephus would not have described Jesus in such a manner. The best explanation of this passage is that it is partly authentic&mdash;it contains what Josephus wrote, along with several additions and/or modifications by Christian scribes. It would be a mistake to say this entire passage was not written by Josephus because it is this introduction to Jesus here that provides the context for Josephus's mention of Jesus in the first passage quoted above. This passage explains who <em>Christus</em>, the name Josephus uses for Jesus, which was just a normal name in that time, was and provides the necessary background for understanding Josephus's brief mention of <em>Christus</em> in the first passage. Thus, there is no good reason to believe that this entire passage is a forgery.
