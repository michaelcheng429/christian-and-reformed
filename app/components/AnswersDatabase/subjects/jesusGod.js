        <div>
            <h3>Quick answer</h3>
            <p>Jesus very clearly claimed to be God multiple times in multiple ways.</p>

            <h3>Detailed answer</h3>
            <p>Let's go through the many passages that clearly communicate Jesus' deity.</p>

            <h4>John 1:1 &ndash; The Word was God</h4>

            <img src="/bible.png" style={{ float: 'right' }} />

            <blockquote>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and <strong>the Word was God</strong>. (John 1:1)</blockquote>

            <p>The "Word" here refers to Jesus, and the verse says that "the Word [Jesus] was God." The Greek does not say that Jesus was "a god," as Jehovah's Witnesses claim.</p>

            <h4>John 5:18, John 10:30-33 &ndash; The Jews understood that Jesus was claiming to be God</h4>

            <blockquote>This was why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, <strong>making himself equal with God</strong>. (John 5:18)</blockquote>

            <blockquote> "I and the Father are one." The Jews picked up stones again to stone him. Jesus answered them, "I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you going to stone me?" The Jews answered him, "It is not for a good work that we are going to stone you but for blasphemy, <strong>because you, being a man, make yourself God</strong>."" (John 10:30-33)</blockquote>

            <p>The Jews clearly understood that Jesus calling God his Father and saying "I and the Father are one" meant Jesus "making himself equal with God." Jesus never denied their conclusion.</p>

            <h4>John 8:24, 58-59 &ndash; Jesus claims to be "I am," which God said was His name (Exodus 3:14)</h4>

            <img src="/i-am.png" style={{ float: 'right' }} />

            <blockquote>I told you that you would die in your sins, for unless you believe that <strong>I am</strong> he you will die in your sins. (John 8:24)</blockquote>

            <blockquote>Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, <strong>I am</strong>." (John 8:58-59)</blockquote>

            <blockquote>God said to Moses, "I am who I am."" And he said, "Say this to the people of Israel: '<strong>I am</strong> has sent me to you.'" So they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple. (Exodus 3:14)</blockquote>

            <p>In the Greek, "he" is not present. Jesus intentionally uses God's name when referring to himself. Also, by saying that he existed before Abraham, Jesus was claiming to be eternal, which is another claim to deity. The Jews picked up stones to stone Jesus because they understood what he was saying and considered it blasphemy.</p>

            <h4>John 20:28-29 &ndash; Jesus did not correct Thomas's statement, "My Lord and my God!"</h4>

            <blockquote>Thomas answered him, "My Lord and <strong>my God</strong>!" Jesus said to him, "Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed." (John 20:28-29)</blockquote>

            <p>Here, Thomas calls Jesus "my God." If Jesus did not claim to be God, he would have corrected Thomas. Instead, he affirms Thomas's statement.</p>

            <h4>Matthew 2:2, 14:33, 28:9, John 9:35-38 &ndash; Jesus accepts worship, which can only rightly be given to God</h4>

            <blockquote>...saying, "Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come <strong>to worship him</strong>." (Matthew 2:2)</blockquote>

            <blockquote>And those in the boat <strong>worshiped him</strong>, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God." (Matthew 14:33)</blockquote>

            <blockquote>And behold, Jesus met them and said, "Greetings!" And they came up and took hold of his feet and <strong>worshiped him</strong>. (Matthew 28:9)</blockquote>

            <blockquote>Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him he said, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?" He answered, "And who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?" Jesus said to him, "You have seen him, and it is he who is speaking to you." He said, "Lord, I believe," and <strong>he worshiped him</strong>. (John 9:35-38)</blockquote>

            <p>If Jesus did not claim to be God, he would have corrected his followers, as Paul and Barnabas did in Acts 14. Instead, Jesus accepts their worship, demonstrating that he claimed to be God.</p>

            <h4>Revelation 1:17-18 &ndash; "I am the first and the last"</h4>

            <blockquote>When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. But he laid his right hand on me, saying, "Fear not, <strong>I am the first and the last</strong>, and the living one. I died, and behold I am alive forevermore, and <strong>I have the keys of Death and Hades</strong>." (Revelation 1:17-18)</blockquote>

            <p>Only God can say that he is "the first and the last," and Jesus here says that he is "the first and the last," and that he has "the keys of Death and Hades," which is another claim that only God could make.</p>

            <h4>Colossians 2:9, Philippians 2:5-11, Hebrews 1:8 &ndash; Jesus' followers taught that Jesus was God</h4>

            <blockquote>For <strong>in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily</strong>. (Colossians 2:9)</blockquote>

            <p>This verse is self-explanatory.</p>

            <blockquote>Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though <strong>he was in the form of God</strong>, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that <strong>at the name of Jesus every knee should bow</strong>, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and <strong>every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord</strong>, to the glory of God the Father. (Philippians 2:5-11)</blockquote>

            <p>Here, Paul teaches that Jesus "was in the form of God," and that "every knee" will bow before Jesus, which can only be true of God.</p>

            <blockquote>But of the Son he says, "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom."" (Hebrews 1:8)</blockquote>

            <p>This passage references Psalm 45:6, which says, "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. The scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of uprightness." The author of Hebrews is equating Jesus with the God of Psalm 45:6.</p>
