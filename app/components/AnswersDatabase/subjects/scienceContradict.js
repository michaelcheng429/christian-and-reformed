            <h3>Quick answer</h3>
            <p>There is no science that irrefutably contradicts the Bible. First, science/knowledge itself is impossible without presupposing the Bible because only the Bible provides a logical foundation for human knowledge. Second, the science that supposedly contradicts the Bible is either 1) derived from faulty presuppositions (e.g., excluding the possibility of the supernatural), 2) inconclusive (people often call things conclusive that are simply not, e.g., evolution and the age of the universe), or 3) simply wrong.</p>

            <h3>Detailed answer</h3>
            <h4>Only the Bible provides a logical foundation for knowledge itself</h4>

            <p>Science cannot explain many things, including where human knowledge comes from (as well as where the universe came from and where life came from, among other things). Knowledge, the universe, and life must have come from something outside of themselves, namely, a Creator, or God. There is simply no other explanation, no matter how hard scientists try to determine a naturalistic cause for these things.</p>

            <h4>Faulty presuppositions and inconclusive theories</h4>

            <p>Many scientists/people have faulty presuppositions that distort their conclusions. For example, based on the speed of light and the distance many stars are from Earth, many people conclude that it must have taken millions or billions of years for the light to have reached Earth, and therefore the universe is millions or billions of years old. However, this is hardly a definite conclusion&mdash;perhaps the supernatural was involved (which science cannot test), or perhaps there were factors in the past that scientists are unaware of. At best, scientists can come up with theories concerning these types of things; they cannot conclude with certainty that something in science proves the Bible wrong.</p>

            <p>Another example we can use is evolution. Many of the "conclusions" concerning evolution are based upon the assumption/presupposition that nothing supernatural was involved regarding the development of life and the existence of humans. Then, using this presupposition, people go out looking for "science" that supports this idea. Then, the desperation people have for a naturalistic explanation for the universe combined with many lies about the "evidence" for evolution has led to this theory being as popular and defended as it is today. The "science" for evolution is simply nowhere near as conclusive as many claim it is, and anyone who claims the evidence is conclusive is either deceived, self-deceived, or lying.</p>
