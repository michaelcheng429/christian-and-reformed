            <h3>Quick answer</h3>
            <p>There are several possible explanations for the passages that people bring up to "prove" that God is immoral for giving instructions regarding slavery. For example:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Slavery in the Bible was very different from American slavery.</li>
                <li>Some people voluntarily sold themselves into slavery because of poverty and were set free in six years.</li>
                <li>Some people may be slaves because of sin. This happened to Israelites themselves.</li>
                <li>God may have given instructions for a sinful institution to minimize/prevent abuses.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Anyone who refuses to accept these possible explanations and insists that instructions for slavery in the Bible disproves the Bible is just being stubbornly illogical. There are a number of very reasonable explanations.</p>

            <h3>Detailed answer</h3>
            <p>Let's go through the passages in the Bible that are relevant to this subject. We will start with the most difficult passages, even though having the context of the passages below them would be helpful.</p>

            <h4>Exodus 21:20-21 &ndash; Physical discipline is not immoral, but murder must be punished</h4>

            <blockquote>When a man strikes his slave, male or female, with a rod and the slave dies under his hand, he shall be avenged. But if the slave survives a day or two, he is not to be avenged, for the slave is his money. (Exodus 21:21)</blockquote>

            <p>Physical discipline in itself is not immoral. It can be used rightly to discipline children (Proverbs 13:24 and others). And if the kind of slavery in the Bible was not immoral in itself (see arguments below), then like physically disciplining a child, physically disciplining a slave for disobedience (to right instructions) would not be immoral.</p>

            <p>Abuse of authority would certainly be immoral, and this passage commands punishment for those who discipline their slaves so severely that they die. For the case where a slave survives a day or two, it may be that the slave died from another cause, in which case the master should not be punished for that. This may not be the exact explanation, but it is certainly possible. In any case, there are a number of possible explanations for that verse.</p>

            <p>Many slaves in the Bible voluntarily sold themselves into slavery because of poverty (see Leviticus 25:39-42 below). There is nothing inherently wrong or immoral in this.</p>

            <p>Some foreign people were slaves for life. We will address this in the passage below.</p>

            <h4>Leviticus 25:44-46 &ndash; What about Israelites owning slaves from other nations?</h4>

            <img src="/chains.png" style={{ float: 'right' }} />

            <blockquote>As for your male and female slaves whom you may have: you may buy male and female slaves from among the nations that are around you. You may also buy from among the strangers who sojourn with you and their clans that are with you, who have been born in your land, and they may be your property. You may bequeath them to your sons after you to inherit as a possession forever. You may make slaves of them, but over your brothers the people of Israel you shall not rule, one over another ruthlessly. (leviticus 25:44-46)</blockquote>

            <p>First, this passage says nothing about kidnapping people or forcing people to become slaves. It is possible that these slaves from other nations had also sold themselves into slavery because of poverty and were more like bondservants.</p>

            <p>Second, since the Bible commands the death penalty for those who "steal and sell" a person (see Exodus 21:16 below), we can assume that it would also be immoral for an Israelite to buy a person who has been stolen and sold in such a way. Although Israelites may have done this, and although kings such as Solomon (1 Kings 9:15) instituted forced labor/slavery, this does not mean God approved of this. Solomon fell from favor in God's sight.</p>

            <p>Third, if the possession of foreign slaves for life was immoral for Israel (and this is not necessarily the case, as God's command to kill the entire population of pagan nations was not immoral because of the sin of these nations and God's right and authority to decree punishment for sin&mdash;Israel itself was punished for its sin with slavery!), then God may have provided instructions for a sinful institution to prevent abuses (the punishment for murder in Exodus 21:20, and Matthew 19:8 below). God is not required to completely eliminate all sin immediately (that sin still exists in this world means God has an ultimate good purpose for sin). The key is that God never commands people to sin.</p>

            <h4>Matthew 19:8 &ndash; God sometimes gives instructions within sinful institutions</h4>

            <blockquote>Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. (Matthew 19:8)</blockquote>

            <p>Although this may not be the case with slavery in the Bible (see the third point above), it is possible that God gave instructions for slavery in the same way He gave instructions for divorce. Perhaps, like with divorce, the slavery in the Bible was permitted "because of your hardness of heart," and "from the beginning it was not so." The important thing to recognize here is that there are several possible explanations. There is no irrefutable proof that God is immoral for giving instructions for slavery.</p>

            <h4>Leviticus 25:39-42) &ndash; "Slavery," or "bondservanthood," was one way to provide economic relief for the servant, and it was temporary</h4>

            <img src="/coins.png" style={{ float: 'right' }} />

            <blockquote>If your brother becomes poor beside you and sells himself to you, you shall not make him serve as a slave: he shall be with you as a hired worker and as a sojourner. He shall serve with you until the year of the jubilee. Then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him, and go back to his own clan and return to the possession of his fathers. For they are my servants,[e] whom I brought out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as slaves. (Leviticus 25:39-41)</blockquote>

            <p>This is one usage of the word "slave" in the Bible. There is clearly nothing immoral about this.</p>

            <h4>Exodus 21:16 &ndash; Stealing and selling a person warrants the death penalty</h4>

            <blockquote>Whoever steals a man and sells him, and anyone found in possession of him, shall be put to death. (Exodus 21:16)</blockquote>

            <p>This differentiates biblical "slavery" from the slavery used in this argument, which involves "stealing"/kidnapping people from African and selling them for profit. Biblical slavery involves voluntary selling into slavery because of poverty, as seen in the passage above.</p>

            <h4>Exodus 21:1-6 &ndash; Slavery was sometimes temporary</h4>

            <blockquote>Now these are the rules that you shall set before them. When you buy a Hebrew slave, he shall serve six years, and in the seventh he shall go out free, for nothing. If he comes in single, he shall go out single; if he comes in married, then his wife shall go out with him. If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out alone. But if the slave plainly says, "I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free," then his master shall bring him to God, and he shall bring him to the door or the doorpost. And his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall be his slave forever.</blockquote>

            <p>A slave only served for six years, and then was set free. It is the slave's own decision to take the wife the master gives him, and whether he will leave his family or not. He is not forced to do either. Again, there is no problem here.</p>

            <h4>Exodus 21:7-11 - Female "slavery" was for marriage and had protections for the woman</h4>

            <blockquote>When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she shall not go out as the male slaves do. If she does not please her master, who has designated her for himself, then he shall let her be redeemed. He shall have no right to sell her to a foreign people, since he has broken faith with her. If he designates her for his son, he shall deal with her as with a daughter. If he takes another wife to himself, he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, or her marital rights. And if he does not do these three things for her, she shall go out for nothing, without payment of money. (Exodus 21:7-11)</blockquote>

            <p>This kind of "slavery" is completely different from this argument. Here, the "slavery," is for the purpose of marriage, and if the master does not want the woman, the woman is to be "redeemed," or bought back. If the master does not provide for the woman, then she is to be set free. This may be very different from how we do things in our culture, but there is nothing immoral here, and we see God provide great protections for these women, which the surrounding cultures did not provide.</p>
