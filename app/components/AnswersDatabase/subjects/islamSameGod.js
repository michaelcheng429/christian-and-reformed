            <h3>Quick answer</h3>
            <p>The Christian God is a Trinity which recognizes Jesus and the Holy Spirit as also being persons within that Godhead that are also fully God. This makes the Christian God completely different from the Muslim and Jewish God because Muslims and Jews do not recognize Jesus and the Holy Spirit as being God.</p>

            <h3>Detailed answer</h3>
            <h4>One who does not view Jesus as fully God does not believe in the Christian God</h4>

            <p>Jesus said, "Whoever has seen me has seen the Father" (John 14:9). No Muslim or Jew would agree that seeing Jesus is the equivalent of seeing God. The New Testament has revealed the true nature of God (which the Old Testament hinted at), which is a Trinity. The Trinity is completely different from the Muslim and Jewish conceptions of God.</p>
