    argument: <p>God simply predestines those whom he passively foresees will freely choose Jesus during their lifetime. He does not actively choose some and not others.</p>,
    answer: (
        <div>
            <h3>Quick answer</h3>
            <p>The kind of foreknowledge used in this argument is not the same as God's foreknowledge as defined by the Bible, which is God's intimate knowledge of those He has predestined to save.</p>

            <h3>Detailed answer</h3>
            <h4>What is God's foreknowledge?</h4>
            <p>The idea that God's foreknowledge is merely his passive pre-knowledge of who would free choose Jesus during their lifetime is foreign to the Bible. Rather, the Bible defines God's foreknowledge as God's intimate knowledge of those He has predestined to save.</p>

            <blockquote>Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations. (Jeremiah 1:5)</blockquote>

            <p>This verse talks about God "knowing" Jeremiah before he was born and associates God "knowing" Jeremiah with God "consecrating" and "appointing," or choosing/predestining, Jeremiah for a specific kind of life. God did not choose Jeremiah based upon His foreknowing what Jeremiah would do in his lifetime.</p>

            <p>In Romans 11:2, Paul says that God "foreknew" his people, or Israel.</p>

            <blockquote>God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he appeals to God against Israel? (Romans 11:2)</blockquote>

            <p>It would be silly to think that God "foreknew" that Israel would freelly choose Him. Rather, it is clear that God's "foreknowledge" here refers to His intimate knowledge of the people He sovereignly chose/predestined to be His people.</p>

            <p>Here is another relevant verse:</p>

            <blockquote>To those who are elect exiles of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, according to the foreknowledge of God the Father... (1 Peter 1b-2a)</blockquote>

            <p>This passage says that the "elect exiles" are elect exiles because of, or "according to," the "foreknowledge of God." Again, here "foreknowledge" is inextricably connected to the concept of God actively choosing. This passages does not talk about God passively foreknowing the elect choosing to have faith.</p>

            <h4>Everyone who is "foreknown" by God will be saved</h4>
            <p>Romans 8:29-30 communicates a chain that cannot be broken that starts with God "foreknowing" a person and ends with that person being saved. In other words, everyone whom God "foreknows" will also be predestined, justified, and glorified, or saved.</p>

            <blockquote>For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified. (Romans 8:29-30)</blockquote>

            <p>Here, God's "foreknowledge" is a special knowledge of those He has chosen to predestine/save. This passage says nothing about God simply foreknowing who would freely choose Jesus during their lives, and we saw above that the Bible does not define God's knowledge/foreknowledge in this manner.</p>

            <h4>What's the difference between "foreknowledge" and "predestination"?</h4>
            <p>Some argue that if foreknowledge basically means the same thing as predestination, then why would the Bible use two separate words? We have already referenced the answer above, but foreknowledge is slightly different from predestination in that it is about God intimately knowing whom He would save, and predestination is God acting upon that foreknowledge to actually save.</p>
