    argument: <p>It is arrogant for Christians to claim they have all the answers. It is better to have questions that can't be answered than to claim to have all the answers.</p>,
    answer: (
        <div>
            <h3>Quick answer</h3>
            <p>Christians do not claim to have <strong>all</strong> the answers, or that the answers come from <strong>themselves</strong>. Rather, they claim that <strong>God has revealed</strong> the essential answers about the universe and humans, and they admit that they do not understand all that God has revealed. One could argue that if God has clearly revealed the truth through the Bible, then it would be arrogant to reject this clear revelation.</p>

            <h3>Detailed answer</h3>
            <h4>Christians do not claim to have the answers themselves</h4>

            <img src="/bible.png" style={{ float: 'right' }} />

            <p>It would certainly be arrogant for Christians to claim that they have the answers <strong>themselves</strong>, if they claimed to have figured out the mysteries and truth of the universe <strong>by their own reasoning/intellect</strong>. However, this is not at all what Christians believe (and Christians who believe this are wrong).</p>

            <p>Rather, Christians believe that the answers have come from God himself, that God has revealed the answers to humans through the Bible. And not only that, Christians also believe that they can only discover the answers that he has revealed if God illumines their mind (or, gives them a new regenerated nature that is capable of understanding spiritual things).</p>

            <blockquote>...that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may <strong>give you the Spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him, having the eyes of your hearts enlightened</strong>, that you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints (Ephesians 1:17-18)</blockquote>

            <blockquote>Jesus answered him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God." (John 3:3)</blockquote>

            <p>Christians have nothing to be arrogant about because they did not arrive at an understanding of the truth by their own ability or reasoning. Rather, the only reason they know the truth is because God has unconditionally illumined their minds and given them the ability to understand.</p>

            <h4>Christians do not claim to have all the answers</h4>

            <p>Claiming that the answers are found within God's revelation in the Bible is not the same thing as claiming to have all the answers. Christians believe that they can spend an eternity studying the Bible and never arrive at an understanding of all the answers. They humbly admit that who God is and all he has done is far greater than their limited faculties can fully grasp.</p>

            <blockquote>Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways! (Romans 11:33)</blockquote>

            <img src="/studying-glasses.png" style={{ float: 'left' }} />

            <p>It would indeed by arrogant for Christians to claim that they have all the answers because only God can fully know all the answers. But, this is not at all what Christians claim. God has revealed all the answers that humans need to know in their lives in the Bible, and no Christian will even ever fully understand all of those answers, much less all the answers to everything about God and the universe.</p>

            <h4>Has God clearly revealed the truth through the Bible?</h4>

            <p>God's revelation through the Bible is the necessary foundation for the universe, life, and knowledge itself, so there is no other logical and consistent option other than to believe what God has revealed in the Bible.

            <p>Because God has been clear in his revelation through the Bible, it can be argued that anyone who rejects this truth is the one who is being arrogant in refusing to submit to the truth.</p>
