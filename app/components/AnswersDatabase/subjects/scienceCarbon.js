            <h3>Quick answer</h3>
            <p>First, Carbon-14 dating is a good argument against an old earth because many things that are considered to be millions of years old still have Carbon-14 in them. Second, concluding that something is 50,000 to 100,000 years old based on Carbon-14 dating requires an unjustified assumption that the ratio of Carbon-14 to Carbon-12 in the atmosphere has remained the same for at least that amount of time, which is actually not the case, as even the founder of Carbon-14 dating discovered.</p>
