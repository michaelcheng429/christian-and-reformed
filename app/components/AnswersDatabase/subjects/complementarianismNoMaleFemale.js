    argument: <p>Galatians 3:28 says, "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus." Therefore, men and women are completely equal in every way, including in the family and in the church.</p>,

            <h3>Quick answer</h3>
            <p>Galatians 3:28 is talking about men and women having equal access to God through Jesus Christ, not about roles that God has ordained in the family and in the church. We learn about these God-glorifying roles in other passages of Scripture.</p>

            <h3>Detailed answer</h3>
            <p>Let's take a look at the full context of Galatians 3:28.</p>

            <blockquote>Now before faith came, we were held captive under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith would be revealed. So then, the law was our guardian until Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian, for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith. For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to promise. (Galatians 3:23-29)</blockquote>

            <p>This passage, which is often used as an argument against God ordaining different roles for men and women in the family and in the church, is about salvation being equally accessible for everyone regardless of ethnicity, class, or sex. One must take this passage out of context and ignore other clear teachings in Scripture to believe that this passage teaches that men and women have completely equal roles in the family and in the church. There are other passages in Scripture that clearly define the roles that God has ordained for men and women in the family and in the church, such as Ephesians 5, Colossians 3, 1 Peter 3, and more.</p>
