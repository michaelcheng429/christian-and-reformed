            <h3>Quick answer</h3>
            <p>Every statement is founded upon presuppositions, including an objection against the Bible. The only presuppositions that make the universe, life, and knowledge possible in the first place are biblical presuppositions, which state that an eternal, intelligent, sovereign God is the source of those things. Every other system, upon examination, falls apart at those points (and others), thus requiring the objector to assume biblical presuppositions to even make an argument against the Bible.</p>

            <h3>Detailed answer</h3>
            <h4>Foundational questions</h4>

            <p>There are important questions concerning presuppositions that are foundational to any debate. Nobody approaches a debate from a standpoint of objective neutrality&mdash;anyone who argues something argues from a particular worldview, and the foundational presuppositions of this worldview cannot be ignored.</p>

            <p>So, when someone brings up an objection against the Bible, although it is certainly worthwhile to address the specific objection, there are more foundational questions that are also important:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>From what worldview are you objecting against the Bible?</li>
                <li>Can your worldview provide an explanation for the existence of knowledge, without which you could not even argue against the Bible?</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>There is no neutral, objective worldview</h4>

            <img src="/colored-glasses.png" style={{ float: 'right' }} />

            <p>Some people try to say that they are just looking at the "facts," as if they are arguing from a worldview of objective neutrality. However, again, there are some foundational questions we need to ask these people:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>How do you determine what is a "fact"? Is it by empirical observation, common sense, the scientific method, etc.?</li>
                <li>What is your justification for the answer above? For example, if you said "the scientific method," can you determine the supposed fact, "The scientific method is how we should determine facts," by the scientific method?</li>
                <li>Are there limitations to your answer above? For example, can empirical observation prove the fact that there is such a thing as a number, or that murder is wrong?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The purpose of these questions is not to ignore the objection being raised against the Bible, but rather to point out that the person raising the objection is assuming certain things that may not be legitimate in the first place, which undermines the very objection being raised.</p>

            <h4>Every other worldview breaks down at some point</h4>

            <p>In the quick answer above, we said that "the only presuppositions that make the universe, life, and knowledge possible in the first place are biblical presuppositions, which state that an eternal, intelligent, sovereign God is the source of those things. Every other system, upon examination, falls apart at those points (and others), thus requiring the objector to assume biblical presuppositions to even make an argument against the Bible." Let's take a look at some more specific examples:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Worldviews that cannot explain the existence of the universe, life, or knowledge</strong> &ndash; Any worldview that denies the existence of God or precludes the supernatural fails at this point. This includes atheism, naturalism, and worldviews based upon empiricism, science alone, sensory experience, or the scientific method. One common objection is that we simply need to continue learning through science to eventually find the answers to these questions. However, if one is honest, philosophically, it is simply impossible for science to answer these questions, since those three things require something external of themselves to come into existence. And since this is so, one could not even use science apart from something supernatural making knowledge/science possible. One who clings to science here is simply irrationally desperate to avoid believing in the necessity of something supernatural. We are not saying here that science is wrong, just that it is insufficient as a foundation for a worldview.</li>
                <li><strong>Self-refuting worldviews</strong> &ndash; Agnosticism fails here. If one says, "We cannot know truth," then that "truth" itself could not be known.</li>
                <li><strong>Other worldviews that believe in a God</strong> &ndash; Other religions that also believe in an eternal, intelligent, sovereign God, such as Islam, Judaism, Mormonism, Jehovah's witnesses, and others, can explain the existence of the universe, life, and knowledge, but the problem is that every religion except Christianity is self-contradictory or errant at some point. For example, Islam incorrectly teaches that the Bible has been corrupted and that the Bible never teaches that Jesus claimed to be God, and Mormonism and Jehovah's Witnesses likewise have errors/contradictions in their teachings concerning the Bible. Upon deep examination, only the Bible escapes self-contradiction after scrutiny.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Don't be scared into only playing defense</h4>

            <p>Some opponents of Christianity will intimidate Christians by placing the burden of proof upon Christians, saying that Christians are the ones making ridiculous claims, so they must be the ones to prove/justify these claims. Of course, Christians should be prepared to give a defense for why what they believe is entirely reasonable, but they should not stop there.</p>

            <p>Christians should also ask about and question the presuppositions of those who challenge the Bible. From what foundation are these people challenging the Bible, and if this foundation is non-existent in the first place, then there is something wrong with the objection itself.</p>

            <h4>What the Bible says about presuppositions</h4>

            <p>Here are some things the Bible says that relate to what we have been talking about here:</p>

            <blockquote>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction. (Proverbs 1:7)</blockquote>

            <p>Without "the fear of the Lord," one cannot even begin to have true "knowledge." There are truths about the universe that are dependent upon a proper understanding of God.</p>

            <blockquote>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth. For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse. For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened. (Romans 1:18-21)</blockquote>

            <p>The truth about God is clear "in the things that have been made," and it is only "by their unrighteousness" that they "suppress the truth." This is the truth about all who refuse to accept the Bible. There is a desperation to escape God's law and obedience to God's law, so people will come up with all kinds of illegitimate objections and arguments against the Bible to sooth their conscience. However, upon examination, these objections and arguments will be found to be without basis.</p>
