    argument: <p>The Bible can't be proved to be true.</p>,
    answer: (
        <div>
            <h3>Quick answer</h3>
            <p>Every statement is founded upon presuppositions, including an objection against the Bible. The only presuppositions that make the universe, life, and knowledge possible in the first place are biblical presuppositions, which state that an eternal, intelligent, sovereign God is the source of those things. Every other system, upon examination, falls apart at those points (and others), or is self-contradictory, thus requiring the objector to assume biblical presuppositions to even make an argument against the Bible.</p>

            <h3>Detailed answer</h3>
            <h4>Foundational questions</h4>

            <p>There are important questions concerning presuppositions that are foundational to any debate. Nobody approaches a debate from a standpoint of objective neutrality&mdash;anyone who argues something argues from a particular worldview, and the foundational presuppositions of this worldview cannot be ignored.</p>

            <p>So, when someone brings up an objection against the Bible, although it is certainly worthwhile to address the specific objection, there are more foundational questions that are also important:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>From what worldview are you objecting against the Bible?</li>
                <li>Can your worldview provide an explanation for the existence of knowledge, without which you could not even argue against the Bible?</li>
                <li>Does your worldview break down at some point due to self-contradiction?</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>There is no neutral, objective worldview</h4>

            <img src="/colored-glasses.png" style={{ float: 'right' }} />

            <p>Some people try to say that they are just looking at the "facts," as if they are arguing from a worldview of objective neutrality. However, again, there are some foundational questions we need to ask these people:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>How do you determine what is a "fact"? Is it by empirical observation, common sense, the scientific method, etc.?</li>
                <li>What is your justification for the answer above? For example, if you said "the scientific method," can you determine the supposed fact, "The scientific method is how we should determine facts," by the scientific method?</li>
                <li>Are there limitations to your answer above? For example, can empirical observation prove the fact that there is such a thing as a number, or that murder is wrong?</li>
                <li>Do you accept the teachings of the Bible as "facts"? If not, how is your determination of what is a "fact" better than the Bible's claim to be the words of God, after answering the questions above?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The purpose of these questions is not to ignore the objection being raised against the Bible, but rather to point out that the person raising the objection is assuming certain things that may not be legitimate in the first place, which undermines the very objection being raised.</p>

            <h4>Every other worldview breaks down at some point</h4>

            <img src="/magnifying-glass.png" style={{ float: 'right' }} />

            <p>In the quick answer above, we said that "the only presuppositions that make the universe, life, and knowledge possible in the first place are biblical presuppositions, which state that an eternal, intelligent, sovereign God is the source of those things. Every other system, upon examination, falls apart at those points (and others), or is self-contradictory, thus requiring the objector to assume biblical presuppositions to even make an argument against the Bible." Let's take a look at some more specific examples:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Worldviews that cannot explain the existence of the universe, life, or knowledge</strong> &ndash; Any worldview that denies the existence of God or precludes the supernatural fails at this point. This includes atheism, naturalism, and worldviews based upon empiricism, science alone, sensory experience, or the scientific method.</p>
                
                    <p>One common objection is that we simply need to continue learning through science to eventually find the answers to these questions. However, if one is honest, philosophically, it is simply impossible for science to answer these questions, since those three things require something external of themselves to come into existence.</p>

                    <p>Another common response is that it is perfectly okay, and actually better/more humble, to admit that one doesn't have all the answers, than to claim to have the answers. However, the problem here is that nothing could possibly even exist or make sense apart from a proper foundation to these questions. A proper answer to these answers is necessary for life and thought itself, and without this foundation, one could not understand, explain, justify, or argue anything at all, much less object against the truth of the Bible.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Self-contradictory worldviews</strong> &ndash; Agnosticism, as well as all other religions apart from Christianity, fails here.</p>

                    <p>Regarding agnosticism, if one says, "We cannot know truth," then that "truth" itself could not be known. Two contradictory statements cannot both be true at the same time ("We cannot know truth" and "The truth is that we cannot know truth"). This would reduce to absolute absurdity.</p>

                    <p>Other religions that believe in an eternal, intelligent, sovereign God also fall apart here. Of course, much more can be said about these things, but as a general summary, Judaism has misunderstood that Jesus is the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy; Islam and Mormonism contain mistakes concerning the supposed "corruption" of the Bible, as well as Jesus' claims to deity, among other things; and Jehovah's Witnesses distort the original text to fit their interpretation of who Jesus is. Since these religions claim to be true, any mistakes within the worldview causes the entire system to collapse.</p>

                    <p>Upon examination, only the biblical worldview escapes collapse due to self-contradiction.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>What the Bible says about presuppositions</h4>

            <p>Here are some things the Bible says that relate to what we have been talking about here:</p>

            <blockquote>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction. (Proverbs 1:7)</blockquote>

            <p>Without "the fear of the Lord," one cannot even begin to have true "knowledge." There are truths about the universe that are dependent upon a proper understanding of God.</p>

            <blockquote>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth. For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse. For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened. (Romans 1:18-21)</blockquote>

            <p>The truth about God is clear "in the things that have been made," and it is only "by their unrighteousness" that they "suppress the truth." This is the truth about all who refuse to accept the Bible. There is a desperation to escape God's law and obedience to God's law, so people will come up with all kinds of illegitimate objections and arguments against the Bible to sooth their conscience. However, upon examination, these objections and arguments will be found to be without basis.</p>

            <p>Of course, we should address objections to the Bible, but this passages teaches that the root cause of rejecting the Bible is not because of logic, but because of sin and a desire not to obey God, since one can only escape the "plainness" of God's truth by "suppressing" the truth. Nobody is an objective evaluator of the truth, but rather, people have a sinful nature that corrupts their questioning.</p>
