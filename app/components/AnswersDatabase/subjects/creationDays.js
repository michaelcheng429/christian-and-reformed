            <h3>Quick answer</h3>
            <p>While it is true that the Hebrew word used here (<em>yom</em>) can sometimes mean a period of time, the context in Genesis 1 constrains it to mean a literal 24 hour day. In the Bible, every time <em>day</em> is used with <em>morning</em>, every time it is used with <em>evening</em>, and every time it is used with a <em>number</em>, it means a literal 24 hour day, and Genesis consistently uses <em>day</em> with <em>morning</em>, <em>evening</em>, and a <em>number</em> (see verses below).</p>

            <h3>Detailed answer</h3>
            <h4>The context of "day" in Genesis determines its meaning</h4>
            <p>In the Bible, every time <em>day</em> is used with <em>morning</em>, every time it is used with <em>evening</em>, and every time it is used with a <em>number</em>, it means a literal 24 hour day, and Genesis consistently uses <em>day</em> with <em>morning</em>, <em>evening</em>, and a <em>number</em>.</p>

            <blockquote>And there was <strong>evening</strong> and there was <strong>morning</strong>, the <strong>first</strong> day. (Genesis 1:5b)</blockquote>
            <blockquote>And there was <strong>evening</strong> and there was <strong>morning</strong>, the <strong>second</strong> day. (Genesis 1:8b)</blockquote>
            <blockquote>And there was <strong>evening</strong> and there was <strong>morning</strong>, the <strong>third</strong> day. (Genesis 1:13)</blockquote>
            <blockquote>And there was <strong>evening</strong> and there was <strong>morning</strong>, the <strong>fourth</strong> day. (Genesis 1:19)</blockquote>
            <blockquote>And there was <strong>evening</strong> and there was <strong>morning</strong>, the <strong>fifth</strong> day. (Genesis 1:23)</blockquote>
            <blockquote>And there was <strong>evening</strong> and there was <strong>morning</strong>, the <strong>sixth</strong> day. (Genesis 1:31b)</blockquote>

            <p>In the context of Genesis 1, it is impossible to interpret "day" (<em>yom</em>) as anything other than a literal 24 hour day. The interpretation that "day" here refers to a long period of time is foreign to the passage.</p>

            <h4>Doesn't this contradict science?</h4>
            <p>Science cannot explain how the universe came into existence. The Bible can, and there is no scientific evidence that irrefutably contradicts the Bible, despite the strong language often used by those who are opposed to the biblical creation account. At best, scientists have theories about the past, which cannot be re-played or re-observed.</p>
